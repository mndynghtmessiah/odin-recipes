    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An easy, dependable meal. Great for autistic people and/or the overworked, burnt out capitalist cog in your life. You can add anything as you go to your tastes, that's the beauty of it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Noodles of your choosing (I prefer spiral egg noodles)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of butter</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese (optional, for topping)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set out a pot of water to boil. Make sure it's at least half the pot, in order to cover the noodles entirely. Salt your water.</li>
        <li>Once water is boiling, add your noodles and turn the heat down to medium-high.</li>
        <li>Once the noodles are al dente, strain.</li>
        <li>Back on the burner, melt your butter in your pot. Brown it just barely.</li>
        <li>Add your noodles, salt, and pepper, and give it a good mix.</li>
        <li>Add parmesan on top, if you'd like.</li>
        <li>That's it! Enjoy an easy safe food.</li>
    </ol>
